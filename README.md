# laravelcomments

Kindly fork this repo and add "@recruiterbeep" as collaborator so that we can review your code.

The purpose of this exercise is to get an idea how comfortable and sound knowledge you have regarding laravel framework. 

The idea is to create commenting system just like facebook. No need of authentication is required in this exercise. I am going to list down all the requirements of this exercise below

## Requirements

1. Seed a dummy single post using laravel Seeder. Post has only two properties title and description. 
2. Seed 100 users using seeder
3. User can comment on the post.
4. User can view others comments
5. User can delete his own comment.
6. User can tag other user in his comments. You can use "@" in order to start searching the user base while posting a comment just like facebook. 
7. Once the user put a comment notify all the concerning users about it through email (Mailtrap).
8. Show total number of comments on the post page.
9. Show date time with every comment
10. Sort the comment with date time recent one first.
11. Comment shown on the screen must have following fileds (1.owner, 2. comment, 3. date time human readable e.g. 2 days ago or 1 minute ago etc, 4. highlight tagged user if there is any the comment.) 
12. Apply cache if required.
13. You can use any front end framework like bootstrap/tailwind of your choice.
